Cantiga Project
===============

Cantiga is a membership management software that helps non-profit organizations running their projects. It was originally created to power
the project of WIO and WIOSNA Associations that gathers more than 30 000 participants every year, and now it is available as an open-source
software for everyone.

Cantiga is written using PHP7 and Symfony Framework 3.1.

If you are interested how Cantiga works, and what features it offers, please take a look at the project website and the user documentation.

If you have any questions, please post them on our discussion list.

License and copyright
---------------------

The project is distributed under the terms of GNU General Public License 3. You can find the full text of the license
in `license/CANTIGA-LICENSE` file.

Put simply, *there's more happiness in giving than in getting*. We give you a nice software (at least we think so), with the right to use it
and modify for any purpose. We expect that if you distribute it further, possibly with your modifications, you'll give it
to the others under exactly the same terms and won't restrict the others' rights.

In practice:
 - you can run your own private website, make some modifications to the source code and keep them private,
 - if you want to allow the others to install the original or modified version, you must give them the full source code, too,
   and you must not change the licensing terms.
